		<description><![CDATA[&gt;Hi,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The way you draw the details it sure sound more iteresting to but the phone yourself, but i think you missed one thing. With the t-mobile sim-only option you only get cheaper minutes within your bundle, outside the bundle you pay the same price per minute as you would do with a normal flex non-sim only bundle. So mutch for your theory?]]></description>
