		<description><![CDATA[&gt;Hi Peter,&lt;br /&gt;Like you, I too am convinced on shortage of addresses, now what? simply talking about it is pointless, can we talk ? Maybe the solutions differ but the end result could be productive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think we should keep in touch with each other.&lt;br /&gt;Virendra Gandhi&lt;br /&gt;HippoCampus&lt;br /&gt;cloucomp@rediffmail.com&lt;br /&gt;91 98241 57580]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;Hi,&lt;br /&gt;I fully agree with you IPv6 cannot solve the address shortage problem Ipv4and 6 both have inherent shortcomings. I am working in this area via a net service which will have location details and allow multiple users to have the same username by providing the user with a relatively small and remember able number, but the number analogy used will be absolutely in -exhaustible i.e. no digits]]></description>
