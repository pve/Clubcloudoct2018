		<description><![CDATA[Your teaching and facilitating were excellent!  Thanks, Peter. Cloud Computing seems to have a vast possibility for emerging countries and businesses because its advantages are perfectly corresponding with needs and wants of them. Investment &#038; cost efficiency, scalability &#038; flexibility, friendliness with mobile devices and resilience to disasters are worthy of mention. It&#039;s critical to select promising service domains and show successful case examples in early stage.  A kind of leapfrogging might be caused as a result of moving into Cloud.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think we need to move past the discussion of &quot;what is and isn&#039;t a broker&quot; and talk about the factors that influence the nature of multi-party scenarios (i.e. scenarios in which the cloud consumer directly or indirectly interacts with multiple cloud providers). I agree with you that, in scenarios in which the consumer interacts with a single provider and has no knowledge of or relationship with any of the downstream providers - there is no effective difference.

I wrote an article about this here: http://recursivedigressions.blogspot.com/2012/03/cloud-broker-overload.html]]></description>
