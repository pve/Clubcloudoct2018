		<description><![CDATA[&gt;well... in my experience, typically the first thing to break are disks (after 2.5-3 year) but the power supply is a runner-up. Having a spare one and hot swappable PSUs are certainly nice to have. &lt;br/&gt;Recently we had another advantage of dual power: the power had te be rewired, and we had no downtime because of two power cords!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stan]]></description>
